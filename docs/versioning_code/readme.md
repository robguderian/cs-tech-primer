Source control
==============

Ideas of branching to work on features/enhancements.

Generally talking about git for flavour of source control. Git via GUI
is "easier", but GUIs are slightly limiting

By the end of this module, students will be able to...

* create a repository locally
* create a remote repository on github, and clone it
* create a commit of code that should be kept
* push code to a remote repository
* create a branch to work on code
* merge a branch with changes into a different (parent) branch
* understand how git is a linked list
* be able to solve simple conflicts
* revert a change (reminding them that this is less important
  if use branches)
* use a merge tool to merge 2 files

Activities
----------

* Check out a git repository that has a known conflict,
  preform a 3-way merge into `main` branch
* Something with [Learn git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
