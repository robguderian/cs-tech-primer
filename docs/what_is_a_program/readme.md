What is a program?
==================

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

* Understand program inputs/outputs (stdin, stdout, stderr)
* Understand what an executable file (Script) is, with `#!`.
  How that works given "everything is a program", and that
  scripting language executables are just files read by
  a program (bash/python)
* be able to use `strings` to pull strings from a program
* understand ELF format, how a program starts.
* know that programs are linked (https://wiki.osdev.org/Linker_Scripts)
  via a linker. That segments _can_ move.
* know how an OS/shell can tell apart a text file from an
  actual executable (binary). (`file` command does this)
  see (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures)


Notes to self

Talk about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Binutils and 
... do things? Rip apart a program?
