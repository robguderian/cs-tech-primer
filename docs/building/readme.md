=================

Building programs locally, and remotely.

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

* use a makefile to execute some simple task
* know why a makefile is better than using a shell script (and much better than pressing
  up 100 times)
* use a makefile as build documentation
* where libraries exist on systems
* understand the dependency resolution/rules of simple makefiles
* how to include libraries that are not system libraries
* understand static vs dynamic linking
