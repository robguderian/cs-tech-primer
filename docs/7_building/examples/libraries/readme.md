Libraries
=========

This is a demonstration of how to create both static, and shared
libraries.

The root makefile builds everything. Then, you can use the makefile
to switch between different shared libraries.

Static libraries
----------------

The inspiration is from
[these notes](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell/cs50/buildlib.html).

Dynamic libraries
-----------------

See [the documetation here](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html#AEN95)
for more depth.
