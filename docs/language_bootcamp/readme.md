Language bootcamp
=================

Need to learn a language for a course? Or, just looking to find out what
a language is like? Look no further.

Hello world in 15(ish) languages (if applicable), with language best
practices. These languages are supported by the CS Unix machines, unless
otherwise stated.

Content of each (available where applicable)

- Fizzbuzz (if/else demo)
- Factorial done recursively
- Some string processing (see below)
- Object demo
- Loops and structures
- How to run it

if possible, discuss

- file i/o
- arguments

String example
--------------

The example shows:

- substring
- search
- index a letter
- split
- Palindromicity

We'll use the Rockyou corpus, which is leaked password (warning, there is
some bad language in the corpus)

Then, find:

- how many passwords have the word 'pass' in it?
- see if you've been owned
- count letter frequencies
- .... we'll probably just use this
- how many palindromes are there in the corpus

Languages
---------

- [Java](java) (if you didn’t do 1st year here)
- C
- C++
- Lua
- Go
- Bash
- Python
- [Node/Javascript](javascript)
- SQL (doesn’t fit well for demos - I have a bunch of sample databases to play with)
- R (Not in the labs currently) (not really R’s strengths, the Dataframes are key)
- Ruby
- rust (Not in the labs currently)
