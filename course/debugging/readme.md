Debugging, and debuggers
========================

Show both command-line debuggers, IDE debuggers

Show some basic strategies:

* Breakpoint before the error
* Inspect variables
* Use conditional breakpoints to wait for the trigger
* Use a debugger with a unit test

By the end of this module students should be able to:

* be comfortable using a debugger.
* be able to set breakpoints, and conditional breakpoints.
* be able to inspect variables in code that is running.
* know that just using print statements in an anti-pattern.
* be able to trigger the error that is being debugged with a unit test.
* know why unit tests are better than debugging by-hand.
