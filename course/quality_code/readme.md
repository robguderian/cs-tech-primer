Writing quality code
====================

Tools to write good code

By the end of this module, students should be able to...

* use a linter to show poorly formatted/styled code
* use a coverage tool to check for untested lines of code
* add style checks to a makefile

Activities
----------

* Give some crummy code (python/java/c) in a UMLearn quiz, accept the
  answer of it spaced properly.
* Have a makefile with build/run/test/style - style calls the one unit
  test with style checks.
